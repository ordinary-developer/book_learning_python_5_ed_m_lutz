 strings
 =======

 Strings are used to record both textual information as well
 as arbitrary collections of bytes.

 
 sequence operations
 ===================

 As sequences, strings suppport operations that ussume a positional
 ordering amount items.

 - len(s) -> gets the length of the string

 - s[i]   -> indexing expression
   Positive indexes count from the left
   Negative indexes count back from the right

 - s[i:j] -> extracts an entire section (slice) in a single step
   s[1:]  - Everyting past the first (1:len(s))
   s      - s itself hasn't changed
   s[0:3] - everyting but the last
   s[:3]  - same as s[0:3]
   s[:-1] - Everything but the last again, but simpler (0:-1)
   s[:]   - All of s as a top-level copy (0:len(s)  
            (first index inlusive, second not)

 - +     -> concatenation
 - *     -> repetion


 immutability
 ============

 Strings are immutable in Python - they cannot be changed in place
 after they are created.

 Numbers, strings and tuples are immutable.
 Lists, dictionaries, and sets are not.
