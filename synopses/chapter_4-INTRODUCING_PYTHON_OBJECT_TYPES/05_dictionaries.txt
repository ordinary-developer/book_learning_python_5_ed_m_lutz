 dictionaries
 ############

 Dictionaries in Python are not sequences at all,
 but are instead known as mappings.
 
 Mappings store objects by key.

 Dictionaries are mutable.
 
 Assignments to new dictionary keys create those keys.

 We can make dictionaries by passing to the "dict" type name
 either keyword arguments (a special name=value syntax in function calls),
 or the result of zipping together sequences of keys and values 
 obtained at runtime.
