 dictionaries
 ############

 Dictionaries in Python are not sequences at all,
 but are instead known as mappings.
 
 Mappings store objects by key.

 Dictionaries are mutable.
 
 Assignments to new dictionary keys create those keys.

 We can make dictionaries by passing to the "dict" type name
 either keyword arguments (a special name=value syntax in function calls),
 or the result of zipping together sequences of keys and values 
 obtained at runtime.


 missing keys: if tests
 ======================

 the dictionary "in" membership expression allows us
 to query the existence of a key.
 
 There are other ways to avoid accessing nonexistent keys in a dictionary
 - the "get" method, a conditional index with a default;
 - the "if/else" ternary expression


 sorting keys: for loops
 =======================

 We can get the keys of a dictionary in a sorted order
 by using the "sorted" function.
 The parameter must be your dictionary.
