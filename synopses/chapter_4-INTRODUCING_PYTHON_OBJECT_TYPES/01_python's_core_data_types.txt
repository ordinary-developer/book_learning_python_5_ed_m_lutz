 python's core data types
 ########################

 Object types are
 - Numbers
 - Strings
 - Lists
 - Dictionaries
 - Tuples
 - Files
 - Sets
 - Other core types (Booleans, types, None)
 - Program unit types (functions, modules, classes)
 - Implementations-related types (compiled code, stack tracebacks)

 Python is dynamically typed and also is strongly typed.
